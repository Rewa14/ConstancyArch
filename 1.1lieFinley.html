            <p class="sty spk Finley">Well duh, it's time travel, of course, you'll be back quick. And no, we could get fired! If you need information then read a book.</p>
            <p class="sty you">I don't have enough time to read a book I'm not even supposed to be back right now!</p>
            <p class="sty spk Finley">I guess I can help you but I won't be the one punching in the coordinates. Here let's go to my CAD and I'll find my manual.</p>
            <p class="sty dsc">You go to Finley's Constancy Arch Dorm and notice Zork's console is open on Finley's computer.</p>
            <p class="sty you">Really Finley how can you even enjoy these games?</p>
            <p class="sty spk Finley">Adventure games like this are amazing, they're like a book that you get to solve. You have to explore the world to know what it looks like and actually have to think about what you can and can't do <sc>(Montfort 683)</sc>.</p>
            <p class="sty you">Ugh sounds boring, let's just find the manual.</p>
            <p class="sty spk Finley">Here it is but remember, if anyone asks, I'm going to say you stole it when I wasn't looking.</p>
            <p class="sty dsc">With the manual, you head back to the time machine.</p>
