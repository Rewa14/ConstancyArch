            <p class="sty spk employee">Hello, what seems to be the issue?</p>
            <p class="sty you">Oh no issue, I was just about to play this game.</p>
            <p class="sty spk employee">Sorry, this game is out of order.</p>
            <p class="sty you">Then why is it here?</p>
            <p class="sty spk employee">The manager likes to keep it for the novelty.</p>
            <p class="sty you">What makes this game so special?</p>
            <p class="sty spk employee">For one thing, the controls are pretty unique but at the same time super sexist as you play the game using two "female breasts"</p>
            <p class="sty you">Oh dang, I thought they were trackballs, nevertheless, how were they able to sell these?</p>
            <p class="sty spk employee">It's because of their target audience if you ever saw the flyers for this game you can tell that Atari really thought games were just for boys. The freaking flyer showed this guy chasing after this blonde girl like an object <sc>(Kocurek 5351)</sc>.</p>
            <p class="sty you">Dang, that sucks.</p>
            <p class="sty spk employee">Yeah, no doubt, sorry to cut this short but I thought I should tell you that your backpack is glowing.</p>
            <p class="sty you">Oh, uh, where's the bathroom?</p>
            <p class="sty spk employee">Right down that hall.</p>
            <p class="sty you">Thanks!</p>
            <p class="sty dsc">You enter the bathroom and take out your disc.</p>
