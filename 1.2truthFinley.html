                <p class="sty you">Yeah, I was talking with him. . .</p>
                <p class="sty spk Finley">I, I don't know what to say. Who knows what you could have messed up! It's a miracle we're still alive for pete's sake!</p>
                <p class="sty you">Finley, calm down, it's not a big deal, there's not much I could have effected by talking with him.</p>
                <p class="sty spk Finley">I don't know, I don't feel so good about this.</p>
                <p class="sty you">Really Finley, you don't have to tell anyone.</p>

                <p class="sty you">Yeah, I'll walk you back to your CAD</p>
                <p class="sty dsc">As you enter her Constancy Arch Dorm you talk about your favorite games with Finley.</p>
                <p class="sty spk Finley">You can't just say that you like classic games without backing that up.</p>
                <p class="sty you">But they're great, I loved them as a kid.</p>
                <p class="sty spk Finley">No one's trying to take that away from you but you gotta remember that nostalgia can cloud how you perceive games. Not to say that they are bad but there's a vagueness and sometimes the praise that you give them is exaggerated <sc>(Swalwell 1320)</sc>.</p>
                <p class="sty you">Fair but I still like them and I don't think you can change my mind.</p>
                <p class="sty dsc">You then eye her time machine manual. You pick up the manual and head back to the time machine you transported with earlier, then flip to the pages on the manual that describe how to change the time and place for sending.</p>
