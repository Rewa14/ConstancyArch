            <p class="sty spk finley">Boy, you did not make it easy to figure out where you were. But I'm glad I was able to reroute your disc to send you here!</p>
            <p class="sty you">Yeah I thought Constancy Arch found me for sure!</p>
            <p class="sty spk finley">They did! But I was able to send them to the arcade.</p>
            <p class="sty you">I'm guessing we can't go back to Constancy Arch then.</p>
            <p class="sty spk finley">Yeah, we're stuck here, so I hope this adventure was worth it.</p>
            <p class="sty you">I think it was worth it because I learned:</p>
            <p class="sty dsc nTx" id="ad">That game companies like Sierra online stopped making games because of the popularity of shooter games.</p>
            <p class="sty dsc sTx" id="mo">Adventure games are a valuable form of media, providing worlds to map out and thought-provoking puzzles to solve.</p>
            <p class="sty dsc nTx" id="sw">Nostalgia needs to kept in check as it can cloud how games are remembered, sometimes exaggerating the praise it deserves.</p>
            <p class="sty dsc sTx" id="ko">There are game companies will cater to boys to sell their games even if it objectifies women.</p>
            <p class="sty dsc nTx" id="ma">Role-playing was seen as a girlish, childish activity, an idea that was popularized by Roger Caillois.</p>
            <p class="sty dsc lTx" id="an">Games have been dominated by a single privileged perspective, which is terrifying because an art form should be open to everyone.</p>
            <p class="sty dsc lTx" id="fl">Including details in games is so important to include as with just a few pieces of information players are able to create a larger story for their actions.</p>
            <p class="sty dsc nTx" id="da">Game companies need to foster better equality practices, as women are not seen as the valuable assets that they are in game creation.</p>
            <p class="sty dsc lTx" id="ar">Games are a form of art as they hold ideas about society and at the same time, they supersede art mediums as games can be created with other art forms.</p>
            <p class="sty dsc nTx" id="ih">Games can provide valuable skills such as better hand-eye coordination which can translate into other fields with examples of players becoming better surgeons.</p>
            <p class="sty spk finley">Oh, shut up!</p>
