People who I've had to argue endlessly at just to get something done, just for them to see the value in ideas I bring up. And they never take what I say seriously, at least not until a man or one of our players brings it to their attention. Women are shunned because they want to be able to make their sexist jokes, they want it to be like a frat and they're succeeding <sc>(D'Anastasio)</sc>.</p>
