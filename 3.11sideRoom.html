            <p class="sty you">What is this?</p>
            <p class="sty spk jordan">This is where I come for some peace and quiet so I can focus on ideas for my game.</p>
            <p class="sty you">Oh, wowâ€¦ This is pretty impressive!</p>
            <p class="sty spk jordan">Why thank you!</p>
            <p class="sty dsc">You point at a section of the board.</p>
            <p class="sty you">Are these all the characters you have in your story?</p>
            <p class="sty spk jordan">Yeah and then everyone they're connected to is marked with the lines.</p>
            <p class="sty you">Okay so yeah your game is definitely heavily story driven!</p>
            <p class="sty spk jordan">I mean not everyone will actually be seen in the game but I like to map it out for my own sake. I figure that if I make my game with these things in mind, that it would give the player a sense that they are actually in a real world. I read somewhere that with just a few pieces of information the imagination of the player will tell them that there is a larger, more complete background for the character and their actions <sc>(Aranda)</sc>. It gives everything more meaning.</p>
            <p class="sty dsc">You continue to talk to her until she realizes that it's the end of the day.</p>
