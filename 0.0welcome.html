            <p class="sty dsc">You are a part of a time travel program whose goal is to observe the past but not interfere. You get to travel back to 2004 to observe Alex Sullivan a professor known to be a video game history buff. Unfortunately, you can't help but go up to him after one of his classes and ask him:</p>
            <p class="sty you">What aspects of video games do you think are the most flawed?</p>
            <p class="sty spk sullivan">Another video game enthusiast I see, well I feel like representation is definitely lacking in this industry. For example, the Williams family of Sierra Online made some of the most successful home games for their time. But their adventure games weren't able to grow at the same pace as popular shooting games so they just stopped making games
                <sc>(Adkins)</sc>.</p>
            <p class="sty you">Sure.</p>
            <p class="sty spk sullivan">Yeah well, unfortunately, the whole industry is basically forgetting about women, favoring the male demographic, which is a real shame because then we'll have less Dona Baileys in the world.</p>
            <p class="sty you">No yeah, it's definitely unfortunate.</p>
            <p class="sty spk sullivan">Is that all you have to say? Got any thoughts on game marketing like Atari's Gotcha or the early perception of gamers in media like Tron?</p>
            <p class="sty you">Uh. . . I thought Tron hasn't come out yet?</p>
            <p class="sty spk sullivan">It came out in '82. What're you talking about?</p>
            <p class="sty you">. . .</p>
            <p class="sty spk sullivan">Are you even in my class because right now you're wasting my time. Come back to me when you have an opinion that you can back up.</p>
